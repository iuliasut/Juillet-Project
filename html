            The Chanel jacket is without a doubt one of fashion’s most
            revolutionary pieces ever created. In the 50s and 60s, the Chanel
            jacket was a status symbol of the British aristocracy as well as for
            fashion icons like Jacqueline Kennedy. In fact, Jackie O wore her
            pink Chanel suit during JFK’s presidency and during his
            assassination. The suit has since become one of the most referenced
            and revisited piece in her closet.

            Little known by many, the Chanel jacket was first designed in 1954
            by Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel to free women from the constraint of the
            wasp-waisted silhouette of the fifties. Coco was already 71 when she
            came out with the Chanel jacket, which was inspired by the man’s
            suit. “It enables women to move with ease, to not feel like they’re
            in a costume. I’m not changing the attitude of mannerism. This time
            it’s very different because human body is always on the move,”
            described Coco of the idea behind the iconic jacket.
